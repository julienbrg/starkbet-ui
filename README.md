# StarkBet

Satoshi Dice Revival on StarkNet.

A live demo is available [here](https://starkbet.vercel.app/). Click on 'Connect', select a value with the slider, then click on 'Bet'.

## Motivation

Back to the roots. We wanted to learn how to implement and deploy a basic smart contract on StarkNet and also learn how to manage interactions with a React app.

We'll using Empiric as a data source for randomness and Braavos as the default wallet.
